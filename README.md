CNV_vs_Gnoto_Pupation_Day.csv --> temporal tracking of pupation in mosquitoes produced by re-capitualted community (CNV) and conventionally reared mosquitoes in standard colony
		
CNV_vs_Gnoto_Wing_Measurements.csv --> wing measurements of adult mosquitoes produced by re-capitualted community (CNV) and conventionally reared mosquitoes in standard colony
	
Cleaned_Manuscript_Code_Animal_Microbiome.Rmd --> executable/knitabble R markdown file to complete all analyses described in the associated manuscript, this file relies on several files also in this repo
	
Isolates_Pupation_Day.csv --> raw data for larval development in gnotobiotic defined microbial background exps 

README_Dataset-PitcherPlantMosquitoMicrobiota_v1.0.0.txt --> readme for dataset uplaoded to dryad server at: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.w0vt4b8sg
	
dataframe_for_diversity_hypothesis_tests_FULL.csv --> dataframe for hypothesis testing of diversity metrics by covariates of interest, but provided here for ease of use
	
decontam_lab_reads_no_outliers.rds --> intermediate phyloseq object needed for several analyses in .rmd

phyloseq_full_analysis_set.rds --> main phyloseq object used in subsequent analyses
